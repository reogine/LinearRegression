# Linear Regression:

is an Algorithm used to make prediction depending on linear relation between DEPENDENT var and INDEPENDENT var , and we get both of them  after analysing the data. 


with linear regression the goal is to find the b0 and b1, that the line best fits the data pts minimizing the errors or the difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
